## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

This challenge allowed me to use the core of HTML and CSS.
Those allowed me to built this quick project according to the challenge's rules.

### Continued development

From this I want and need to keep practicing and being able to do the same with the flexbox and the grid concepts.
Furthermore, going further with CSS and using even more of it's specificities.

## Acknowledgments

Beside getting reminded throuhought the past weeks that [](https://www.frontendmentor.io) is a great website, a particlar YT video from FCC got me hook and your challenge was mentionned.
So I end up doing it.
It was a great experience to get back on track and keep pushing once I was done.
